# Contributing to the Cyclop One Skills Hub

Anyone can add a skill! Skills teach [Cyclop One](https://cyclop.one) how to interact with specific apps or workflows.

## What is a Skill?

A skill is a directory containing two files:
- `skill.json` — machine-readable manifest (name, triggers, steps, metadata)
- `SKILL.md` — human-readable documentation (description, examples, how it works)

No code is required for UI automation skills — just describe what the agent should do step-by-step.

## Submitting a Skill

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new directory: `skills/your-skill-name/`
3. Add `skill.json` (see template below)
4. Add `SKILL.md` (see template below)
5. Open a pull request with a brief description

The registry index (`registry/index.json`) is auto-generated by CI when your PR is merged.

## skill.json Template

```json
{
  "name": "your-skill-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",

    "Step 3: How it finishes"
  ],
  "maxIterations": 20,
  "category": "communication",

1. Step 1

## Notes

```

## Naming Rules

- Skill names use **kebab-case**: `gmail-compose`, `notion-create-page`
- Names should be `{app}-{action}` or `{action}-{target}` format
- Keep names short and descriptive

## Categories

| Category | Use For |
|---|---|
| `communication` | Email, messaging, chat apps |
| `productivity` | Notes, tasks, calendars, docs |
| `social` | Social media platforms |
| `browser` | Web browsing, web apps |
| `files` | File management, local apps |
| `other` | Everything else |

## Quality Guidelines

- **Triggers** should be lowercase phrases that naturally match how users speak
- **Steps** should describe visual/UI actions clearly ("Click the Compose button", "Type X in the search bar")
- **maxIterations**: use 10–15 for simple tasks, 20–30 for multi-step workflows
- Test your skill with Cyclop One before submitting

## Skills with Executable Tools

If your skill includes custom executables (scripts or binaries), it requires additional security review and must include a `tools` section in `skill.json`. See the [advanced skills guide](docs/advanced-skills.md) for details.
